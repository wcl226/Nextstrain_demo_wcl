Data preparation guide
**********************

To use Nextstrain to analyze your own data, you'll need to prepare two files:

1. A FASTA file with viral genomic sequences
2. A corresponding TSV file with metadata describing each sequence

We describe the following ways to prepare data for a SARS-CoV-2 analysis:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :titlesonly:

   local-data
   gisaid-search
   gisaid-full

Alternatively, use pre-curated data files:

1. :ref:`Nextstrain remote inputs <remote-inputs-open-files>`
2. `CDC: US State and Territory subsample datasets and example builds <https://github.com/CDCgov/usa-sars-cov-2-nextstrain-sets>`__
