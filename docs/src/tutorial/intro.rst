Introduction
============

These tutorials will walk you through the process of running a basic genomic surveillance workflow using SARS-CoV-2 data.
We've created these resources with the goal of enabling Departments of Public Health to start using Nextstrain to understand their SARS-CoV-2 genomic data within 1-2 hours.

At the end, you will be able to:

- create phylogenetic trees of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different sources including GISAID and Nextstrain-curated GenBank data
- visualize the resulting trees in :term:`docs.nextstrain.org:Auspice`
- define subsampling logic for your own genomic epidemiological analysis

If you prefer to learn about the workflow through videos, see the :doc:`demo videos <videos>`.
