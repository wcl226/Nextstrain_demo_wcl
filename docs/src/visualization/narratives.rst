Nextstrain Narratives
=====================

Nextstrain Narratives allow you to pair a specific view of a dataset with text and images to generate scrollable, interactive reports.

For examples, `see our weekly Situation Reports <https://nextstrain.org/ncov-sit-reps>`__ from the first several months of the pandemic.

You can `read more about narratives <https://nextstrain.org/docs/narratives/introduction>`__ or `watch our Nextstrain narratives tutorial videos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsFWZl6SQqWxN9SkbgdjU8sylIfhZNDiW>`_. We've also `provided a template narrative file <https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/tree/master/narratives/template_narrative.md>`__ for you to edit.

You can preview the template narrative by navigating to https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/nextstrain/ncov/template_narrative.

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to `ask for help <https://discussion.nextstrain.org/>`__.
