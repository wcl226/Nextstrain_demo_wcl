This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the genetic relationships among sampled viruses are generally quite clear, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of specific transmission dates and in reconstruction of geographic spread. Please be aware that specific inferred geographic transmission patterns and temporal estimates are only a hypothesis.

Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 8 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year. Mutational fitness is calculated using results from [Obermeyer et al (under review)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.07.21263228v1). Full details on bioinformatic processing can be found [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).

We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata made available through [GISAID](https://gisaid.org) on which this research is based.

At the specific request of GISAID, we:
 - maintain the prefix `hCoV-19/` in the names of viral isolates
 - disable download of full metadata TSV and provide instead an acknowledgments TSV in the "Download Data" link at the bottom of the page
 - refrain from sharing alignments or other intermediate files computed in our pipeline
